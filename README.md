# DL_projecct

Sapir & Racheli


<u> things we want to change : </u>
1. add augmentation 
2. change number of cutouts in an image ( instead of 1 , we will make 2/3 .. ), change shape, change inensity
3. contact encoder 
4. dropout for cnn (spatialDropout) 

* we need to check any of those 4 options seperattly and then check combinations of them. 

* finally, we can show that the best model is good for other models ( wide resnet, others.. ) 

* we need to change the names of the cutout classes ( cutout_intesity.py -> cutout_intensity.py , cutout.py )
